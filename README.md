# Machine Learning Coursework

This coursework consists of a portfolio divided into two parts with equal weight:

- Part 1 consists of selected homework handed in throughout the course.
The final deliverable consists of a single PDF file, which may include reflective
answers to theoretical exercises, snippets of Python code and solved
exercises.
- Part 2 consists of a machine learning project where students implement a
basic machine learning algorithm for solving a given task. The deliverable is a
zip file with the code, and a written summary (up to 1200 words) describing
solutions, design choices and a reflection on the main challenges faced during
development.
