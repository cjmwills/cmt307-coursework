    "A rule-based system involves a set of pre-defined rules that are applied to data. The output of which are known as the answers. This system does not seek to learn from the input provided, it simply executes the rules defined. For example, if the height of a person is above 180cm label them 'tall', otherwise label them 'small'. \n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning system is trained, rather than defined, by providing it with data and answers (only if it is supervised machine learning). The system looks for statistical structure in this input and outputs the rules to be used. For example, predict the height of school children in Cardiff by learning from data that provides the age and height of school children in Swansea."

By providing the system with the 'answer' it is able learn the statistical characteristics of an observation that leads to a particular output (continuous or categorical). The resulting algorithm can then be used to predict future, unknown outputs. For example, predicting height given age by providing the height and age of school children.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is when a machine learning system is only provided with input variables, no output variables are supplied. The system can't predict outcome as no 'answer' is supplied. Instead, it has to produce an algortihm to classify each observation to a pre-defined number of groups. To do this it looks for statistical similarities between the observations. For example, grouping animals that are similar given information about their size and speed."

    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning system produces an algorithm that too specifically fits itself to the training data provided. This will often result in high accuracy on that one dataset, but low accuracy when applied to new, unseen data. A system that is overfitting will try to over complicate the model and will not take into account the element of randomness (known as white noise) that occurs in each observation."

    "To begin I calculated the proportion of tweets considered hate speech. This gives a good benchmark for our model as it should perform at least as better as if we always guessed the outcome that was more common. Of the 9,000 tweets, 3,783 were flagged as hate speech, this translates to 42%. Therefore if we always guessed that a tweet was not hateful, we would be correct 58% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To preprocess the data I split each tweet into tokens. This means splitting it into it's component words, symbols, and punctuation. To ensure similar words weren't being double counted I also lemmatized each token. Without lemmatization \"shoe\" and \"shoes\" are counted as different words for example. I then removed stopwords from this list of unique tokens, common stopwords were removed using the `nltk` module, I also added some common punctuation to the list of stopwords such as full stops and commas. I then sorted the list of tokens from most frequent to least frequent and took the top 100 to be my attributes to use in the SVM classifier. I believed this provided enough information for the classifier but it's a parameter that could easily be tweaked to discover the most appropriate value. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then counted the number of occurences of each of these attributes in every different tweet. This produced a numeric list of length 100 for each tweet in the data. Now it's in a form the a SVM classifier can use. Instead of splitting the data into one training and one test set I used 10-fold cross validation. This is a good way to maximise the amount of data your machine learning model can use but it can also be computationally expensive if your data is large. For each fold of the cross-validation the  data was split into a training and test set and the attributes were calculated for that fold only. I then fit a SVM linear classifier and recorded accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure for each fold. \n",

    "We can see the accuracy of the model is around 74%. This seems significantly more accuracte than if we guessed every tweet was not hate speech (58%). Interestingly, recall is lower than all other measures, averaging at 55% across the 10 folds. Recall is the proportion of hate tweets that were correctly predicted as hate speech. That is, of the tweets that were considered hate speech, our model correctly predicted 55% of them. Meaning the other 45% were predicted not to be hateful. This is where the context of the problem is key, as this will determine which measure we are trying to maximise. If we are only interested in flagging as many hateful tweets as possible then we would look to build a model that maximises recall. However, we may not want to incorrectly flag tweets as hate speech as this may anger twitter users, in which case we'd want to maximise precision. "
