Wine dataset

The dataset is related to a white variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference paper. 

The datasets can be viewed as regression task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). 

Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
